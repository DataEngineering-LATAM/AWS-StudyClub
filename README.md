# DEMO - 1

For our Step Function state machine, we are going to start by using a Lambda function that checks the extension of an incoming 
file to determine the type of file. Once determined, we'll pass that information on to the next state, which is a CHOICE state. If it
is a file type we support, we'll call a Lambda function to process the file, but if it's not, we'll send out a notification, indicating that we cannot process the file.

If the Lambda function fails, we'll send a notification to report on the failure; otherwise,
we will end the state machine with a SUCCESS status.
